📊 Task 2 - Sentiment and Thematic Analysis

Welcome to the **Task 2** branch of the **mobile-banking-review-analysis** project! 🚀

This branch contains the work focused on analyzing customer reviews of mobile banking apps using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The main goal is to extract valuable insights about user sentiment and common themes from the reviews.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Use pretrained models (e.g., DistilBERT fine-tuned on SST-2) to classify reviews as Positive or Negative and assign confidence scores.

- 🗂️ **Thematic Analysis**  
  Extract key topics and keywords from reviews to identify common themes and user concerns.

- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Perform initial data cleaning and visualization to understand the distribution and patterns of reviews.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- \`transformers\` (Hugging Face) for sentiment classification  
- \`pandas\` for data manipulation  
- NLP libraries like \`spaCy\`, \`scikit-learn\`, or \`nltk\` for keyword extraction and text processing  
- Visualization tools (e.g., \`matplotlib\`, \`seaborn\`) for EDA plots
