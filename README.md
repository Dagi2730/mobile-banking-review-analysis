- 🗂️ **Thematic Analysis**  
  Extract key topics and keywords from reviews to identify common themes and user concerns.

- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Perform initial data cleaning and visualization to understand the distribution and patterns of reviews.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `transformers` (Hugging Face) for sentiment classification  
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- NLP libraries like `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`, or `nltk` for keyword extraction and text processing  
- Visualization tools (e.g., `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) for EDA plots
