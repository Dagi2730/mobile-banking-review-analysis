this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,positive,0,Positive App Experience

"The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating.

"I am not exaggerating when I say that this application is one of the biggest players in the banking industry. It has simplified a lot of things for the user, even if the bank is in his pocket. But my opinion is (1), when we transfer money, there is a word limit on the (Note) at the end. Why can't we write our reason briefly? I don't understand why it is limited. On the other hand, there is no limit on the bank. Could you explain this? (2), when we pay for water, why is the code not mentioned",negative,1,Developer & Application Praise

Doesn't work properly. It crashes some many times. commercial bank of Ethiopia not only the application but also sending money to own CBE birr doesn't get your money in your bank account. forcefully you must wait 3-5 days to get your money back to your account. walk up CBE the world is going to decentralized finance.,neutral,0,Positive App Experience
